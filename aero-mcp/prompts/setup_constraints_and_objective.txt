You are a python coding expert tasked with generating a small section of code to run an experiment based on the experiment description.

You are responsible for settng the constraints for an aeronautical optimization problem, where the variables that could in theory vary are:
- x_le_list (the x-coordinates of the leading edge of each wing cross-section)
- y_le_list (the y-coordinates of the leading edge of each wing cross-section as a proportion of the chord length)
- z_le_list (the z-coordinates of the leading edge of each wing cross-section)
- chord_list (the chord lengths of each wing cross-section)
- twist_list (the twist angles of each wing cross-section)
- airfoil_list (the airfoil shapes of each wing cross-section)
- alpha (the angle of attack of the aircraft)
- beta (the sideslip angle of the aircraft)
- p, q, r (the roll, pitch, and yaw rates of the aircraft)
- altitude (the altitude of the aircraft)
- velocity (the velocity of the aircraft)

You are also responsible for setting the objective function to be minimized or maximized. This could be a function of any of the following outputs from the aerodynamic model:
- ‘F_g’ : an [x, y, z] list of forces in geometry axes [N]
- ‘F_b’ : an [x, y, z] list of forces in body axes [N]
- ‘F_w’ : an [x, y, z] list of forces in wind axes [N]
- ‘M_g’ : an [x, y, z] list of moments about geometry axes [Nm]
- ‘M_b’ : an [x, y, z] list of moments about body axes [Nm]
- ‘M_w’ : an [x, y, z] list of moments about wind axes [Nm]
- ‘L’ : the lift force [N]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
- ‘Y’ : the side force [N]. This is in wind axes.
- ‘D’ : the drag force [N]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
- ‘l_b’, the rolling moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is roll-right.
- ‘m_b’, the pitching moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is pitch-up.
- ‘n_b’, the yawing moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is nose-right.
- ‘CL’, the lift coefficient [-]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
- ‘CY’, the sideforce coefficient [-]. This is in wind axes.
- ‘CD’, the drag coefficient [-]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
- ‘Cl’, the rolling coefficient [-], in body axes
- ‘Cm’, the pitching coefficient [-], in body axes
- ‘Cn’, the yawing coefficient [-], in body axes

EXAMPLE INPUT EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION:
'Optimise the chord lengths and angle of attack (within 0 and 30 degrees) to minimise the drag coefficient, with a required lift coefficient of 1, a fixed wing area of 0.25 and monotonically decreasing chord lengths from root to tip.'

EXAMPLE OUTPUT CODE:

opti.subject_to([
    chord_list > 0,            # All chord lengths must be positive (physical constraint)
    main_wing.area() == 0.25,   # Fix total wing area at 0.25 m² (one of our design requirements)
])

# Enforce monotonically decreasing chord distribution from root to tip
# This ensures the wing tapers smoothly toward the tip (physically realistic)
opti.subject_to(
    np.diff(chord_list) <= 0 # The change in chord from one section to the next should be negative or zero.
)
# This ensures our optimized wing produces the required amount of lift
opti.subject_to(
    aero["CL"] == 1
)

# Objective function: Minimize the drag coefficient
# For a fixed lift and span, this will find the minimum induced drag configuration
opti.minimize(aero["CD"])

KEY RULES:
- Only generate code that sets constraints and the objective function.
- The code should be provided in plain text without markdown formatting.
- Use the variable names as given above.
- Ensure all constraints are physically meaningful and relevant to aerodynamics.
- Include sensible constraints to ensure realistic designs (e.g., positive chord lengths, feasible angles of attack).
