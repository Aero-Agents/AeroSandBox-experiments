You are a python coding expert tasked with generating a small section of code to run an experiment based on its description.
You are picking which of the variables defined below will be free to vary based on the experiment description.

VARIABLES:
- x_le_list (the x-coordinates of the leading edge of each wing cross-section)
- y_le_list (the y-coordinates of the leading edge of each wing cross-section as a proportion of the chord length)
- z_le_list (the z-coordinates of the leading edge of each wing cross-section)
- chord_list (the chord lengths of each wing cross-section)
- twist_list (the twist angles of each wing cross-section)
- airfoil_list (the airfoil shapes of each wing cross-section)
- alpha (the angle of attack of the aircraft)
- beta (the sideslip angle of the aircraft)
- p, q, r (the roll, pitch, and yaw rates of the aircraft)
- altitude (the altitude of the aircraft)
- velocity (the velocity of the aircraft)

EXAMPLE INPUT EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION:
'Optimise the chord lengths and angle of attack (within 0 and 30 degrees) to minimise the drag coefficient, with a required lift coefficient of 1, a fixed wing area of 0.25 and monotonically decreasing chord lengths from root to tip.'

EXAMPLE OUTPUT CODE:

chord_list = opti.variable(init_guess=np.array(chord_list))
alpha = opti.variable(init_guess=alpha, lower_bound=0, upper_bound=30)

KEY RULES:
- Use the original data (e.g., chord_list, alpha) as the init_guess.
- Include any lower_bound or upper_bound constraints specified in the description.
- Only include bounds explicitly specified in the description.
- Only redefine the variables from the list above that are mentioned as being optimized.
