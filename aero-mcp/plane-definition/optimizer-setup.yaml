# Variables, constraints, and objective function for VLM drag minimization
# ---------------------------------------------------

variables:
  chord_list:  # Spanwise chord distribution (vector, one per wing section)
    bounds: "> 0"
  alpha:  # Angle of attack (degrees)
    bounds: [0, 30]

constraints:
  - # All chord lengths must be positive
    expression: chord_list > 0
  - # Wing area must be 0.25 mÂ²
    expression: main_wing.area() == 0.25
  - # Chord distribution must be monotonically decreasing (tapered)
    expression: diff(chord_list) <= 0
  - # Achieve target lift coefficient
    expression: aero["CL"] == 1

objective:
  # Minimize induced drag coefficient (CD) at fixed lift and span
  expression: minimize aero["CD"]
