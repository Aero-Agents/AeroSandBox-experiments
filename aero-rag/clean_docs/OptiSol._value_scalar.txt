.. py:method:: OptiSol._value_scalar(x)

   Gets the value of a variable at the solution point. For developer use - see following paragraph.

   This method is basically a less-powerful version of calling `sol(x)` - if you're a
       user and not a developer, you almost-certainly want to use that method instead, as those are less

       for other developers to subclass OptiSol, if they wish to intercept the variable substitution process.

   :param x:

   Returns:
