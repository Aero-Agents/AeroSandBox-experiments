.. py:method:: Airplane.generate_cadquery_geometry(minimum_airfoil_TE_thickness = 0.001, fuselage_tol = 0.0001)

   Uses the CADQuery library (OpenCASCADE backend) to generate a 3D CAD model of the airplane.

   :param minimum_airfoil_TE_thickness: The minimum thickness of the trailing edge of the airfoils, as a fraction
   :param of each airfoil's chord. This will be enforced by thickening the trailing edge of the airfoils if:
   :param necessary. This is useful for avoiding numerical issues in CAD software that can arise from extremely:
   :param thin:
   :type thin: i.e., <1e-6 meters
   :param tol: The geometric tolerance (meters) to use when generating the CAD geometry. This is passed directly to the CADQuery

   Returns: A CADQuery Workplane object containing the CAD geometry of the airplane.
