.. py:method:: OperatingPoint.total_pressure()

   Total (stagnation) pressure of the working fluid.

   Assumes a calorically perfect gas (i.e. specific heats do not change across the isentropic deceleration).

   Note that `total pressure != static pressure + dynamic pressure`, due to compressibility effects.

   Returns: Total pressure of the working fluid. [Pa]
