.. py:method:: MassProperties.is_physically_possible()

   Checks whether it's possible for this MassProperties object to correspond to the mass properties of a real
   physical object.

   Assumes that all physically-possible objects have a positive mass (or density).

   Some special edge cases:

       - A MassProperties object with mass of 0 (i.e., null object) will return True. Note: this will return
       True even if the inertia tensor is not zero (which would basically be infinitesimal point masses at
       infinite distance).

       - A MassProperties object that is a point mass (i.e., inertia tensor is all zeros) will return True.

   :returns: True if the MassProperties object is physically possible, False otherwise.
