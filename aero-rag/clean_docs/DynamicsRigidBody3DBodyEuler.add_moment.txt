.. py:method:: DynamicsRigidBody3DBodyEuler.add_moment(Mx = 0, My = 0, Mz = 0, axes='body')

   Adds a moment (in whichever axis system you choose) to this Dynamics instance.

   :param Mx: Moment about the x-axis in the axis system chosen. Assumed these moments are applied about the center of mass. [Nm]
   :param My: Moment about the y-axis in the axis system chosen. Assumed these moments are applied about the center of mass. [Nm]
   :param Mz: Moment about the z-axis in the axis system chosen. Assumed these moments are applied about the center of mass. [Nm]
   :param axes: The axis system that the specified moment is in. One of:
                * "geometry"
                * "body"
                * "wind"
                * "stability"
                * "earth"

   Returns: None (in-place)
