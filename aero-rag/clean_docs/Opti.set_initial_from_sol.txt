.. py:method:: Opti.set_initial_from_sol(sol, initialize_primals=True, initialize_duals=True)

   Sets the initial value of all variables in the Opti object to the solution of another Opti instance. Useful
   for warm-starting an Opti instance based on the result of another instance.

   Args: sol: Takes in the solution object. Assumes that sol corresponds to exactly the same optimization
   problem as this Opti instance, perhaps with different parameter values.

   Returns: None (in-place)
