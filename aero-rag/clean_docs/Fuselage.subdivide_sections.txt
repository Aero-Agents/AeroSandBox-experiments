.. py:method:: Fuselage.subdivide_sections(ratio, spacing_function = np.linspace)

   Generates a new Fuselage that subdivides the existing sections of this Fuselage into several smaller ones. Splits
   each section into N=`ratio` smaller subsections by inserting new cross-sections (xsecs) as needed.

   This can allow for finer aerodynamic resolution of sectional properties in certain analyses.

   :param ratio: The number of new sections to split each old section into.
   :param spacing_function: A function that takes in three arguments: the start, end, and number of points to generate.

                            The default is `np.linspace`, which generates a linearly-spaced array of points.

                            Other options include `np.cosspace`, which generates a cosine-spaced array of points.

   Returns: A new Fuselage object with subdivided sections.
