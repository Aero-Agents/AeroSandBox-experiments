.. py:method:: MassProperties.generate_possible_set_of_point_masses(method='optimization', check_if_already_a_point_mass = True)

   Generates a set of point masses (represented as MassProperties objects with zero inertia tensors), that, when
   combined, would yield this MassProperties object.

   Note that there are an infinite number of possible sets of point masses that could yield this MassProperties
   object. This method returns one possible set of point masses, but there are many others.

   .. rubric:: Example

   >>> mp = MassProperties(mass=1, Ixx=1, Iyy=1, Izz=1, Ixy=0.1, Iyz=-0.1, Ixz=0.1)
   >>> point_masses = mp.generate_possible_set_of_point_masses()
   >>> mp.allclose(sum(point_masses))  # Asserts these are equal, within tolerance
   True

   :param method: The method to use to generate the set of point masses. Currently, only "optimization" is supported.

   :returns: A list of MassProperties objects, each of which is a point mass (i.e., zero inertia tensor).
