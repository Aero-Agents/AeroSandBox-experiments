.. py:method:: AeroSandboxObject.save(filename = None, verbose = True, automatically_add_extension = True)

   Saves the object to a binary file, using the `dill` library.

   Creates a .asb file, which is a binary file that can be loaded with `aerosandbox.load()`. This can be loaded
       into memory in a different Python session or a different computer, and it will be exactly the same as when it
       was saved.

   :param filename: The filename to save this object to. Should be a .asb file.
   :param verbose: If True, prints messages to console on successful save.
   :param automatically_add_extension: If True, automatically adds the .asb extension to the filename if it doesn't
                                       already have it. If False, does not add the extension.

   Returns: None (writes to file)
