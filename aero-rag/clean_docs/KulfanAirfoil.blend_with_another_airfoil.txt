.. py:method:: KulfanAirfoil.blend_with_another_airfoil(airfoil, blend_fraction = 0.5)

   Blends this airfoil with another airfoil. Merges both the coordinates and the aerodynamic functions.

   :param airfoil: The other airfoil to blend with.
   :param blend_fraction: The fraction of the other airfoil to use when blending. Defaults to 0.5 (50%).

                          * A blend fraction of 0 will return an identical airfoil to this one (self).

                          * A blend fraction of 1 will return an identical airfoil to the other one (`airfoil` parameter).
   :param n_points_per_side: The number of points per side to use when blending the coordinates of the two airfoils.

   Returns: A new airfoil that is a blend of this airfoil and another one.
