.. py:method:: XFoil.cl(cl, start_at = 0)

   Execute XFoil at a given lift coefficient, or at a sequence of lift coefficients.

   :param cl: The lift coefficient [-]. Can be either a float or an iterable of floats, such as an array.
   :param start_at: Chooses whether to split a large sweep into two runs that diverge away from some central value,
   :param to improve convergence. As an example:
   :param if you wanted to sweep from cl=-1.5 to cl=1.5:
   :param you might want to:
   :param instead do two sweeps and stitch them together: 0 to 1.5, and 0 to -1.5. `start_at` can be either:

                                                          * None, in which case the cl inputs are run as a single sequence in the order given.

                                                          * A float that corresponds to an lift coefficient, in which case the cl inputs are
                                                          split into two sequences that diverge from the `start_at` value. Successful runs are then sorted by
                                                          `alpha` before returning.

   Returns: A dictionary with the XFoil results. Dictionary values are arrays; they may not be the same shape as
   your input array if some points did not converge.
