.. py:method:: MassProperties.export_AVL_mass_file(filename)

   Exports this MassProperties object to an AVL mass file.

   Note: AVL uses the SolidWorks convention for inertia tensors, which is different from the typical
   mathematical convention, and the convention used by this MassProperties class. In short, these differ by a
   sign flip in the products of inertia. More details available in the MassProperties docstring. See also:

   :param filename: The filename to export to.

   Returns: None
