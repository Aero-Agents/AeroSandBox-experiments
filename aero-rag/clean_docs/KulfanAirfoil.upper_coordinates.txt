.. py:method:: KulfanAirfoil.upper_coordinates(x_over_c = np.linspace(1, 0, 101))

   Returns an Nx2 ndarray of [x, y] coordinates that describe the upper surface of the airfoil.

   Order is from the trailing edge to the leading edge.

   Includes the leading edge point; be careful about duplicates if using this method in conjunction with
   Airfoil.lower_coordinates().
