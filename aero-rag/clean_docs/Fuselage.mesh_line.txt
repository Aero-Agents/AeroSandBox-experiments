.. py:method:: Fuselage.mesh_line(y_nondim = 0.0, z_nondim = 0.0)

   Returns points along a line that goes through each of the FuselageXSec objects in this Fuselage.

   :param y_nondim: The nondimensional (width-normalized) y-coordinate that the line should go through. Can either
   :param be a single value used at all cross-sections:
   :param or can be an iterable of values to be used at the:
   :param respective cross-sections.:
   :param z_nondim: The nondimensional (height-normalized) z-coordinate that the line should go through. Can either
   :param be a single value used at all cross-sections:
   :param or can be an iterable of values to be used at the:
   :param respective cross-sections.:

   Returns: A list of points, where each point is a 3-element array of the form `[x, y, z]`. Goes from the nose
   to the tail.
