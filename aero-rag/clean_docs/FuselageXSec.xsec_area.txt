.. py:method:: FuselageXSec.xsec_area()

   Computes the FuselageXSec's cross-sectional (xsec) area.

   The computation method is a closed-form approximation for the area of a superellipse. The exact equation for
   the area of a superellipse with shape parameter `s` is:

       area = width * height * (gamma(1 + 1/n))^2 / gamma(1 + 2/n)

   where gamma() is the gamma function. The gamma function is (relatively) computationally expensive to evaluate
   and differentiate, so we replace this area calculation with a closed-form approximation (with essentially no
   loss in accuracy):

       area = width * height / (s^-1.8717618013591173 + 1)

   This approximation has the following properties:

       * It is numerically exact for the case of s = 1 (a diamond)

       * It is numerically exact for the case of s = 2 (a circle)

       * It is correct in the asymptotic limit where s -> infinity (a square)

       * In the range of sensible s values (1 < s < infinity), its error is less than 0.6%.

       * It always produces a positive area for any physically-meaningful value of s (s > 0). In the range of s
       values where s is physically-meaningful but not in a sensible range (0 < s < 1), this equation will
       over-predict area.

   The value of the constant seen in this expression (1.872...) is given by log(4/pi - 1) / log(2), and it is
   chosen as such so that the expression is exactly correct in the s=2 (circle) case.
