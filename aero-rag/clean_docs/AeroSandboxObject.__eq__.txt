.. py:method:: AeroSandboxObject.__eq__(other)

   Checks if two AeroSandbox objects are value-equivalent. A more sensible default for classes that represent
   physical objects than checking for memory equivalence.

   This is done by checking if the two objects are of the same type and have the same __dict__.

   :param other: Another object.

   :returns: True if the objects are equal, False otherwise.
   :rtype: bool
