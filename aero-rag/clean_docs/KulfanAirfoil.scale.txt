.. py:method:: KulfanAirfoil.scale(scale_x = 1.0, scale_y = 1.0)

   Scales a KulfanAirfoil about the origin.

   :param scale_x: Amount to scale in the x-direction. Note: not supported by KulfanAirfoil due to inherent
                   limitations of parameterization; only given here so that argument symmetry to Airfoil.scale() is
                   retained. Raises a ValueError if modified, along with instructions to use `Airfoil` if needed.
   :param scale_y: Amount to scale in the y-direction. Scaling by a negative y-value will result in `lower_weights`
                   and `upper_weights` being flipped as appropriate.

   Returns: A copy of the KulfanAirfoil with appropriate scaling applied.
