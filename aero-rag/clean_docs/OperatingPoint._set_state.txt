.. py:method:: OperatingPoint._set_state(new_state = None)

   Force-overwrites all state variables with a new set (either partial or complete) of state variables.

   Warning: this is *not* the intended public usage of OperatingPoint instances.
   If you want a new state yourself, you should instantiate a new one either:
       a) manually, or
       b) by using OperatingPoint.get_new_instance_with_state()

   Hence, this function is meant for PRIVATE use only - be careful how you use this!
