.. py:method:: NonlinearLiftingLine.run(solve = True)

   Computes the aerodynamic forces.

   Returns a dictionary with keys:
       - 'residuals': a list of residuals for each horseshoe element
       - 'F_g' : an [x, y, z] list of forces in geometry axes [N]
       - 'F_b' : an [x, y, z] list of forces in body axes [N]
       - 'F_w' : an [x, y, z] list of forces in wind axes [N]
       - 'M_g' : an [x, y, z] list of moments about geometry axes [Nm]
       - 'M_b' : an [x, y, z] list of moments about body axes [Nm]
       - 'M_w' : an [x, y, z] list of moments about wind axes [Nm]
       - 'L' : the lift force [N]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
       - 'Y' : the side force [N]. This is in wind axes.
       - 'D' : the drag force [N]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
       - 'l_b', the rolling moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is roll-right.
       - 'm_b', the pitching moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is pitch-up.
       - 'n_b', the yawing moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is nose-right.
       - 'CL', the lift coefficient [-]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
       - 'CY', the sideforce coefficient [-]. This is in wind axes.
       - 'CD', the drag coefficient [-]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
       - 'CDi' the induced drag coefficient
       - 'CDp' the profile drag coefficient
       - 'Cl', the rolling coefficient [-], in body axes
       - 'Cm', the pitching coefficient [-], in body axes
       - 'Cn', the yawing coefficient [-], in body axes

   Nondimensional values are nondimensionalized using reference values in the VortexLatticeMethod.airplane object.
