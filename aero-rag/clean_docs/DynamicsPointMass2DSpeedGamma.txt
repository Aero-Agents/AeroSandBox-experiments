   Bases: :py:obj:`aerosandbox.dynamics.point_mass.point_3D.speed_gamma_track.DynamicsPointMass3DSpeedGammaTrack`


   Dynamics instance:
   * simulating a point mass
   * in 2D
   * with velocity parameterized in speed-gamma space.

   State variables:
       x_e: x-position, in Earth axes. [meters]
       z_e: z-position, in Earth axes. [meters]
       speed: Speed; equivalent to u_w, the x-velocity in wind axes. [m/s]
       gamma: Flight path angle. [rad]

   Indirect control variables:
       alpha: Angle of attack. [degrees]

   Control variables:
       Fx_w: Force along the wind-x axis. [N]
       Fz_w: Force along the wind-z axis. [N]



   .. py:attribute:: mass_props

      For each state variable, self.state_var = state_var

      For each indirect control variable, self.indirect_control_var = indirect_control_var

      For each control variable, self.control_var = 0


   .. py:property:: state
      :type: Dict[str, Union[float, aerosandbox.numpy.ndarray]]


      Returns the state variables of this Dynamics instance as a Dict.

      Keys are strings that give the name of the variables.
      Values are the variables themselves.

      This method should look something like:
          >>> {
          >>>     "x_e": self.x_e,
          >>>     "u_e": self.u_e,
          >>>     ...
          >>> }
