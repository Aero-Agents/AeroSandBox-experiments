.. py:method:: Airfoil.scale(scale_x = 1.0, scale_y = 1.0)

   Scales an Airfoil about the origin.

   :param scale_x: Amount to scale in the x-direction.
   :param scale_y: Amount to scale in the y-direction. Scaling by a negative y-value will result in coordinates
                   being re-ordered such that the order of the coordinates is still correct (i.e., starts from the
                   upper-surface trailing edge, continues along the upper surface to the nose, then continues along the
                   lower surface to the trailing edge).

   Returns: A copy of the Airfoil with appropriate scaling applied.
