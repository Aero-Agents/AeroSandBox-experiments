.. py:method:: DynamicsPointMass3DCartesian.convert_axes(x_from, y_from, z_from, from_axes, to_axes)

   Converts a vector [x_from, y_from, z_from], as given in the `from_axes` frame, to an equivalent vector [x_to,
   y_to, z_to], as given in the `to_axes` frame.

   Identical to OperatingPoint.convert_axes(), but adds in "earth" as a valid axis frame. For more documentation,
   see the docstring of OperatingPoint.convert_axes().

   Both `from_axes` and `to_axes` should be a string, one of:
           * "geometry"
           * "body"
           * "wind"
           * "stability"
           * "earth"

   :param x_from: x-component of the vector, in `from_axes` frame.
   :param y_from: y-component of the vector, in `from_axes` frame.
   :param z_from: z-component of the vector, in `from_axes` frame.
   :param from_axes: The axes to convert from. See above for options.
   :param to_axes: The axes to convert to. See above for options.

   Returns: The x-, y-, and z-components of the vector, in `to_axes` frame. Given as a tuple.
