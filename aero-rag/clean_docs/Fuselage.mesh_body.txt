.. py:method:: Fuselage.mesh_body(method='quad', tangential_resolution = 36)

   Meshes the fuselage as a solid (thickened) body.

   Uses the `(points, faces)` standard mesh format. For reference on this format, see the documentation in
   `aerosandbox.geometry.mesh_utilities`.

   :param method: A string, which determines whether to mesh the fuselage as a series of quadrilaterals or triangles.

                  * "quad" meshes the fuselage as a series of quadrilaterals.

                  * "tri" meshes the fuselage as a series of triangles.
   :param tangential_resolution: An integer, which determines the number of points to use to mesh each cross-section.

   Returns: Standard unstructured mesh format: A tuple of`points` and `faces`, where:

       * `points` is a `n x 3` array of points, where `n` is the number of points in the mesh.

       * `faces` is a `m x 3` array of faces if `method` is "tri", or a `m x 4` array of faces if `method` is "quad".

           * Each row of `faces` is a list of indices into `points`, which specifies a face.
