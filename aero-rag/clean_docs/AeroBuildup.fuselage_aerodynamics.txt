.. py:method:: AeroBuildup.fuselage_aerodynamics(fuselage, include_induced_drag = True)

   Estimates the aerodynamic forces, moments, and derivatives on a fuselage in isolation.

   Assumes:
       * The fuselage is a body of revolution aligned with the x_b axis.
       * The angle between the nose and the freestream is less than 90 degrees.

   Moments are given with the reference at Fuselage [0, 0, 0].

   Uses methods from Jorgensen, Leland Howard. "Prediction of Static Aerodynamic Characteristics for Slender Bodies
   Alone and with Lifting Surfaces to Very High Angles of Attack". NASA TR R-474. 1977.
