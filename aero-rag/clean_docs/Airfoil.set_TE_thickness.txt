.. py:method:: Airfoil.set_TE_thickness(thickness = 0.0)

   Creates a modified copy of the Airfoil that has a specified trailing-edge thickness.

   Note that the trailing-edge thickness is given nondimensionally (e.g., as a fraction of chord).

   :param thickness: The target trailing-edge thickness, given nondimensionally (e.g., as a fraction of chord).

   Returns: The modified airfoil.
