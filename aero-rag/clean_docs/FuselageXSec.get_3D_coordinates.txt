.. py:method:: FuselageXSec.get_3D_coordinates(theta = None)

   Samples points from the perimeter of this FuselageXSec.

   :param theta: Coordinate in the tangential-ish direction to sample points at. Given in the 2D FuselageXSec
   :param coordinate system:
                             * y_2D points along the (global) y_g
                             * z_2D points along the (global) z_g

                             In other words, a value of:

                                 * theta=0     -> samples points from the right side of the FuselageXSec
                                 * theta=pi/2  -> samples points from the top of the FuselageXSec
                                 * theta=pi    -> samples points from the left side of the FuselageXSec
                                 * theta=3pi/2 -> samples points from the bottom of the FuselageXSec
   :param where:
                 * y_2D points along the (global) y_g
                 * z_2D points along the (global) z_g

                 In other words, a value of:

                     * theta=0     -> samples points from the right side of the FuselageXSec
                     * theta=pi/2  -> samples points from the top of the FuselageXSec
                     * theta=pi    -> samples points from the left side of the FuselageXSec
                     * theta=3pi/2 -> samples points from the bottom of the FuselageXSec

   Returns: Points sampled from the perimeter of the FuselageXSec, as a [x, y, z] tuple.

       If theta is a float, then each of x, y, and z will be floats.

       If theta is an array, then x, y, and z will also be arrays of the same size.
