.. py:method:: Wing.mean_sweep_angle(x_nondim=0.25)

   Returns the mean sweep angle (in degrees) of the wing, relative to the x-axis.
   Positive sweep is backwards, negative sweep is forward.

   This is purely measured from root to tip, with no consideration for the sweep of the individual
   cross-sections in between.

   :param x_nondim: The nondimensional x-coordinate of the cross-section to use for sweep angle computation.

                    * If you provide 0, it will use the leading edge of the cross-section.

                    * If you provide 0.25, it will use the quarter-chord point of the cross-section.

                    * If you provide 1, it will use the trailing edge of the cross-section.

   :returns: The mean sweep angle, in degrees.
