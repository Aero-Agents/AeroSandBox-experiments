.. py:method:: Airplane.draw_three_view(axs=None, style = 'shaded', show = True)

   Draws a standard 4-panel three-view diagram of the airplane using Matplotlib backend. Creates a new figure.

   :param axs: A 2D numpy array of Matplotlib axes objects, with shape at least (2, 2). Each subplot must be 3D. If
   :param None:
   :param creates a new figure with the required axes.:
   :param style: Determines what drawing style to use for the three-view. A string, one of:

                 * "shaded"
                 * "wireframe"
   :param show: A Boolean of whether to show the figure after creating it, or to hold it so that the user can
   :param modify the figure further before showing.:

   Returns: A 2D NumPy array of Matplotlib axes objects, with shape (2, 2). The axes are arranged as follows:

           * axs[0, 0]: Top view
           * axs[0, 1]: Front view
           * axs[1, 0]: Side view
           * axs[1, 1]: Isometric view
