.. py:method:: Airplane.export_XFLR5_xml(filename, mass_props = None, include_fuselages = False, mainwing = None, elevator = None, fin = None)

   Exports the airplane geometry to an XFLR5 `.xml` file. To import the `.xml` file into XFLR5, go to File ->
   Import -> Import from XML.

   :param filename: The filename to export to. Should include the ".xml" extension.
   :param mass_props: The MassProperties object to use when exporting the airplane. If not specified, will default to
                      a 1 kg point mass at the origin.

                      - Note: XFLR5 does not natively support user-defined inertia tensors, so we have to synthesize an equivalent
                      set of point masses to represent the inertia tensor.
   :param include_fuselages: Whether to include fuselages in the export.
   :param mainwing: The main wing of the airplane. If not specified, will default to the first wing in the airplane.
   :param elevator: The elevator of the airplane. If not specified, will default to the second wing in the airplane.
   :param fin: The fin of the airplane. If not specified, will default to the third wing in the airplane.

   Returns: None, but exports the airplane geometry to an XFLR5 `.xml` file.

       To import the `.xml` file into XFLR5, go to File -> Import -> Import from XML.
