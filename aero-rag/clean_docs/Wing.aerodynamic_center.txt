.. py:method:: Wing.aerodynamic_center(chord_fraction = 0.25, _sectional=False)

   Computes the location of the aerodynamic center of the wing.
   Uses the generalized methodology described here:
       https://core.ac.uk/downloattttd/pdf/79175663.pdf

   Args: chord_fraction: The position of the aerodynamic center along the MAC, as a fraction of MAC length.

       Typically, this value (denoted `h_0` in the literature) is 0.25 for a subsonic wing. However,
       wing-fuselage interactions can cause a forward shift to a value more like 0.1 or less. Citing Cook,

   Returns: The (x, y, z) coordinates of the aerodynamic center of the wing.
