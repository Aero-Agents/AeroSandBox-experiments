.. py:method:: FuselageXSec.compute_frame()

   Computes the local coordinate frame of the FuselageXSec, in aircraft geometry axes.

   xg_local is aligned with the FuselageXSec's normal vector.

   zg_local is roughly aligned with the z-axis of the aircraft geometry axes, but projected onto the FuselageXSec's plane.

   yg_local is the cross product of zg_local and xg_local.

   Returns: A tuple:
       xg_local: The x-axis of the local coordinate frame, in aircraft geometry axes.
       yg_local: The y-axis of the local coordinate frame, in aircraft geometry axes.
       zg_local: The z-axis of the local coordinate frame, in aircraft geometry axes.
