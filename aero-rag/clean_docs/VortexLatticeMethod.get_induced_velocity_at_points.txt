.. py:method:: VortexLatticeMethod.get_induced_velocity_at_points(points)

   Computes the induced velocity at a set of points in the flowfield.

   :param points: A Nx3 array of points that you would like to know the induced velocities at. Given in geometry axes.

   Returns: A Nx3 of the induced velocity at those points. Given in geometry axes.
