.. py:method:: Wing.span(type = 'yz', include_centerline_distance=False, _sectional = False)

   Computes the span, with options for various ways of measuring this (see `type` argument).

   If the wing is symmetric, both left/right sides are included in order to obtain the full span. In the case
   where the root cross-section is not coincident with the center plane (e.g., XZ plane), this function's
   behavior depends on the `include_centerline_distance` argument.

   :param type: One of the following options, as a string:

                * "xyz": First, computes the quarter-chord point of each WingXSec. Then, connects these with
                straight lines. Then, adds up the lengths of these lines.

                * "xy" or "top": Same as "xyz", except it projects each line segment onto the XY plane before adding up the
                lengths.

                * "yz" (default) or "front": Same as "xyz", except it projects each line segment onto the YZ plane (i.e., front view)
                before adding up the lengths.

                * "xz" or "side": Same as "xyz", except it projects each line segment onto the XZ plane before adding up the
                lengths. Rarely needed.

                * "x": Same as "xyz", except it only counts the x-components of each line segment when adding up the
                lengths.

                * "y": Same as "xyz", except it only counts the y-components of each line segment when adding up the
                lengths.

                * "z": Same as "xyz", except it only counts the z-components of each line segment when adding up the
                lengths.
   :param include_centerline_distance: A boolean flag that tells the function what to do if a wing's root is not
   :param coincident with the centerline plane:
                                                * If True, we first figure out which WingXSec has its quarter-chord point closest to the centerline
                                                plane (i.e., XZ plane). Then, we compute the distance from that quarter-chord point directly to the
                                                centerline plane (along Y). We then add that distance to the span calculation. In other words,
                                                the fictitious span connecting the left and right root cross-sections is included.

                                                * If False, this distance is ignored. In other words, the fictitious span connecting the left and
                                                right root cross-sections is not included. This is the default behavior.

                                                Note: For computation, either the root WingXSec (i.e., index=0) or the tip WingXSec (i.e., index=-1)
                                                is used, whichever is closer to the centerline plane. This will almost-always be the root WingXSec,
                                                but some weird edge cases (e.g., a half-wing defined on the left-hand-side of the airplane,
                                                rather than the conventional right-hand side) will result in the tip WingXSec being used.
   :type coincident with the centerline plane: i.e., XZ plane
   :param _sectional: A boolean. If False, returns the total span. If True, returns a list of spans for each of the
                      `n-1` lofted sections (between the `n` wing cross-sections in wing.xsec).
