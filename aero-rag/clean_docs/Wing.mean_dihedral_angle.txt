.. py:method:: Wing.mean_dihedral_angle(x_nondim=0.25)

   Returns the mean dihedral angle (in degrees) of the wing, relative to the XY plane.
   Positive dihedral is bending up, negative dihedral is bending down.

   This is purely measured from root to tip, with no consideration for the dihedral of the individual
   cross-sections in between.

   :param x_nondim: The nondimensional x-coordinate of the cross-section to use for sweep angle computation.

                    * If you provide 0, it will use the leading edge of the cross-section.

                    * If you provide 0.25, it will use the quarter-chord point of the cross-section.

                    * If you provide 1, it will use the trailing edge of the cross-section.

   :returns: The mean dihedral angle, in degrees
