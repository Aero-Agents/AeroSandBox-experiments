.. py:method:: AeroBuildup.run()

   Computes the aerodynamic forces and moments on the airplane.

   Returns: a dictionary with keys:

       - 'F_g' : an [x, y, z] list of forces in geometry axes [N]
       - 'F_b' : an [x, y, z] list of forces in body axes [N]
       - 'F_w' : an [x, y, z] list of forces in wind axes [N]
       - 'M_g' : an [x, y, z] list of moments about geometry axes [Nm]
       - 'M_b' : an [x, y, z] list of moments about body axes [Nm]
       - 'M_w' : an [x, y, z] list of moments about wind axes [Nm]
       - 'L' : the lift force [N]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
       - 'Y' : the side force [N]. This is in wind axes.
       - 'D' : the drag force [N]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
       - 'l_b', the rolling moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is roll-right.
       - 'm_b', the pitching moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is pitch-up.
       - 'n_b', the yawing moment, in body axes [Nm]. Positive is nose-right.
       - 'CL', the lift coefficient [-]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
       - 'CY', the sideforce coefficient [-]. This is in wind axes.
       - 'CD', the drag coefficient [-]. Definitionally, this is in wind axes.
       - 'Cl', the rolling coefficient [-], in body axes
       - 'Cm', the pitching coefficient [-], in body axes
       - 'Cn', the yawing coefficient [-], in body axes

       Nondimensional values are nondimensionalized using reference values in the AeroBuildup.airplane object.

       Data types:
           - The "L", "Y", "D", "l_b", "m_b", "n_b", "CL", "CY", "CD", "Cl", "Cm", and "Cn" keys are:

               - floats if the OperatingPoint object is not vectorized (i.e., if all attributes of OperatingPoint
               are floats, not arrays).

               - arrays if the OperatingPoint object is vectorized (i.e., if any attribute of OperatingPoint is an
               array).

           - The "F_g", "F_b", "F_w", "M_g", "M_b", and "M_w" keys are always lists, which will contain either
           floats or arrays, again depending on whether the OperatingPoint object is vectorized or not.
