.. py:method:: FittedModel.goodness_of_fit(type='R^2')

   Returns a metric of the goodness of the fit.

   :param type: Type of metric to use for goodness of fit. One of:

                * "R^2": The coefficient of determination. Strictly speaking only mathematically rigorous to use this
                for linear fits.

                * "mean_absolute_error" or "mae" or "L1": The mean absolute error of the fit.

                * "root_mean_squared_error" or "rms" or "L2": The root mean squared error of the fit.

                * "max_absolute_error" or "Linf": The maximum deviation of the fit from any of the data points.

   Returns: The metric of the goodness of the fit.
