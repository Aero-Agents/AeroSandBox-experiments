.. py:method:: OperatingPoint.convert_axes(x_from, y_from, z_from, from_axes, to_axes)

   Converts a vector [x_from, y_from, z_from], as given in the `from_axes` frame, to an equivalent vector [x_to,
   y_to, z_to], as given in the `to_axes` frame.

   Both `from_axes` and `to_axes` should be a string, one of:
       * "geometry"
       * "body"
       * "wind"
       * "stability"

   This whole function is vectorized, both over the vector and the OperatingPoint (e.g., a vector of
   `OperatingPoint.alpha` values)

   Wind axes rotations are taken from Eq. 6.7 in Sect. 6.2.2 of Drela's Flight Vehicle Aerodynamics textbook,
   with axes corrections to go from [D, Y, L] to true wind axes (and same for geometry to body axes).

   :param x_from: x-component of the vector, in `from_axes` frame.
   :param y_from: y-component of the vector, in `from_axes` frame.
   :param z_from: z-component of the vector, in `from_axes` frame.
   :param from_axes: The axes to convert from.
   :param to_axes: The axes to convert to.

   Returns: The x-, y-, and z-components of the vector, in `to_axes` frame. Given as a tuple.
