.. py:method:: FuselageXSec.equivalent_radius(preserve='area')

   Computes an equivalent radius for non-circular cross-sections. This may be necessary when doing analysis that
   uses axisymmetric assumptions.

   Can either hold area or perimeter fixed, depending on whether cross-sectional area or wetted area is more
   important.

   :param preserve: One of:

                    * "area": holds the cross-sectional area constant

                    * "perimeter": holds the cross-sectional perimeter (i.e., the wetted area of the Fuselage) constant

   Returns: An equivalent radius value.
